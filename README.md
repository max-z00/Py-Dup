# Py-Dup
### DISCLAIMER: This project was made for research purposes. Anything you do with this code is on you and is not my responsibility.
Py-Dup is a simple Python malware that duplicates its code and then executes it automatically to create. Instances of itself, it is minimal and compact. In the future, I plan to add this repo to other examples of self-replicating python viruses.
